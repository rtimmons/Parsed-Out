Code Conventions
=======================

TODO: add more code conventions

Tasks
--------------

Mark inline tasks with comments with the following special markers in all
upper-case. I'm not using upper-case here because I don't want these to be
found as tasks by automation scripts :).

 +  **todo**
    
    Used for stubs and general "come back here"s.  These should get turned
    into bugs or use cases.  These should not be bugs since those should be
    indicated with 'fixme' or 'xxx' in all upper-case.

    Generally, production code shouldn't have "todo"s in it except those for
    features to be added in later sprints.

 +  **fixme**

    Used for bugs found while doing other coding. Example, you're working on a
    bugfix and stumble across another possible bug. Mark it with a `//fixme`
    (in all upper-case).  
    
    These should get turned into bugs.  Production code shouldn't be shipped
    with "fixme"s unless they are accounted for in later sprints.

 +  **xxx**
    
    Used for blocker bugs or bad, temporary hacks.

    These should get turned into bugs.  Production code can't ship with "xxx"s
    in it.

After a task has been turned into a bug, you can annotate it with the bug or
use case number. E.g.:

    public class Foo {
        // todo: fix up (Bug 85)
        public static void main(String[] args) { }
    }

(The `todo` should be capitalized.). The bug or use-case annotation is
free-form and isn't parsed by any scripts; it's just a handy reference to see
that tasks are accounted for.
