Tools Tests
=================

This directory contains tests for the repo-man Tools. Since the tools are
mostly scripts, the tests are mostly scripts.

To run the repo-man tests, run the `run_tests.sh` script inside this directory
in the following manner (remember that `Tools/Trunk` should just be checked
out as `Tools`, and the `$REPOMANTOOlSDIR` should be set to the disk path of
your checkout):

    cd $REPOMANTOOlSDIR/test
    ./run_tests.sh
