The `Users` directory has a subdirectory for each developer working on
projects (should be the user's login name for the repo so it matches with
commit messages). Users can put personal projects, branches of code, and
whatever else there.

This is also where users can put weekly status reports if the organization
requires them as well as contact information so other developers know how to
get ahold of them.
