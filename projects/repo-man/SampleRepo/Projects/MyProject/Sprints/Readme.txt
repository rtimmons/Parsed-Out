Sprints
====================

Our "sprint" might be called a "milestone" or an "iteration" in other terms.
Typically a sprint will have the following things associated with it:

 +  use cases to focus on
 +  bugs to fix

The "current heartbeat" of the project can be seen by looking at the current
sprint in the repository at `Sprints/Current`.
