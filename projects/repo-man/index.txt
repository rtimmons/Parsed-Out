Tools
-------------

 +  [findroot](./findroot.txt)



Sprints
-----------------------

Our "sprint" might be called a "milestone" or an "iteration" in other terms.  Typically a sprint will have the following things associated with it:

 +  use cases to focus on
 +  bugs to fix

The "current heartbeat" of the project can be seen by looking at the current sprint in the repository (Sprints/Current).


The Wiki
------------------------

The wiki should be in plain text, Markdown format.  The Wiki should not contain things like model descriptions or class descriptions:  those belong in the JavaDocs.

"The creation of a document is an implicit agreement to keep it up to date or destroy it." <http://www.agile-process.org/proverbs.html>

"Ideas move faster than documents." <http://www.agile-process.org/proverbs.html>


Recommended wiki scripts:

 +  wiki2html:  generates html output of the wiki:

        #!/bin/bash
        rm -r ../Target/Wiki
        cd Wiki
        for I in *.txt; do
            basename="$(basename -s .txt "$I")"
            Markdown.pl "$I" > "../Target/Wiki/$basename.html"
        done
        cp -r Media ../Target/Wiki/Media



Bug and Task Tracking
------------------------

Here's what a bug creation might look like (assuming we have a shell function `nextbugnumber` that gets us the next bug number):

    $ cat > Sprints/Future/Bugs/`nextbugnumber`.txt <<EOINPUT
    Description: Users with birthday before 12/1/09 don't show up in list view

    Estimated Time: 3 days

    Developers: Ryan

    Repro Steps:

     1. Create a user in the UI
     2. Change birthday to 11/30/09
     3. Switch to list view

    Test Information:
    EOINPUT

This should be written using Perforce form syntax for easy parsing.

Recommended bug scripts:

 *  nextbugnumber: gives next bug number
