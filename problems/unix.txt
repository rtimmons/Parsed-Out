# *NIX Bits


## How to Use these Commands:

 1. Highlight all of the text with your fancy, space-age mouse,

 2. Copy (*Control+C*), and

 3. In PuTTY, simply right-click

    (note that *Control+V* does **not** paste in PuTTY).


## The Commands

 * **Start the BaSH Shell**

        bash

 *  **Enable colors and "nice" paths on the command line**:

        {{lang:bash}}
        wget http://uwwebpub.com/tools/bash_profile.sh  \
            && cat bash_profile.sh >> ~/.bash_profile   \
            && rm bash_profile.sh                       \
            && source ~/.bash_profile
