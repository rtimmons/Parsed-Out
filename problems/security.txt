# Web Site Security

This is the outline for what will eventually turn into online
curriculum for Catalyst's Web Site Security Workshop.

## Basic Few-Member `.htaccess` Directives

### Sample `.htaccess` File to Disable Indexing:

    {{lang:apache}}
    IndexIgnore *

### Sample `.htaccess` File to require *Any* UWNetID

    {{lang:apache}}
    AuthType UWNetID
    Require valid-user

### Sample `.htaccess` File to Limit to Just Two UWNetIDs:

    {{lang:apache}}
    AuthType UWNetID
    require user rtimmons byronm

## Basic Many-Member `.htaccess` Directives

### Sample `.htgroups` file:

    {{lang:apache}}
    friends: rtimmons vuongm
    peers: morgar
    teachers: tanimoto

## Sample `.htaccess` File for Requiring A Group:

    {{lang:apache}}
    AuthType UWNetID
    Require user rtimmonsAuthType UWNetID
    AuthGroupFile ../.htgroup
    Require group friends peers

(Note that this will allow anyone belonging to *either* `friends` *or*
`peers` in.)

## Custom Authentication

### Sample `.htaccess` file for Custom Authentication

    {{lang:apache}}
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Protected"
    AuthUserFile ./.htpasswd
    AuthGroupFile ./.htgroup
    Require group users

### Creating a `.htpasswd` File:

Type the following into the terminal:

    {{lang:bash}}
    htpasswd -c .htpasswd user

Where `user` is the user you'd like to add. The created file is
hash-encrypted.

### Updating an Existing `.htaccess` File:

    {{lang:bash}}
    htpasswd .htpasswd user

Where `user` is the user whose password you would like to change or
add.
