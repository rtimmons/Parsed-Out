# Programming Walkthrough

Imagine you do some data collection from the user and you obtain the
following bit of code:

    var name     = ?;
    var age      = ?;
    var password = ?;

(where `?` is replaced by values from the user.) You now want to only
let the user enter if

 *  his name is 'Sir Elton John', 
 *  his age is greater than 50, and
 *  the password is 'tinydancer'.

Assume you "let the user enter" by setting the variable `enter` to a
true or false value.

    {{lang:javascript}}
    var enter = false;
    if (    name == 'Sir Elton John' 
         && age > 5  
         && password == 'tinydancer )
    {
        enter = true;
    }
