# Example Page

This is an example page. This page as its own internal stylesheet making
[links](http://example.org) green.

I can add source code easily in lots of languages such as PHP

    {{lang:php}}
    <?php
    function counter()
    {
        static $i = 0;
        return $i++;
    }
    
or maybe HTML

    {{lang:html}}
    <table> <tr><td>Foo</td>  <td>Bar</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Fud</td>  <td>Baz</td></tr> </table>

and a "hidden" block:

{hidden}

This is a hidden block. It will be displayed as usual in the plaintext parsed
version, but the HTML version will replace the `{hidden}` lines with `<div
class="showhide">` which are then turned into what you see normally on the
page using jQuery.

{/hidden}

Everything above the tripe-equals sign above is optional. The parser assumes
default css and javascript and will assume no title if one isn't given and
will assume that I (Ryan Timmons) am the author if one is not specified.
