## About Me

My name is Ryan Timmons. I am 22 (as of 07 Sep 2009) and work as a code monkey
for *Cisco Systems* in the *Linksys* group. My day job is writing Java, PHP,
and front-end code (JS/CSS/HTML, etc.). I've been coding for about 10 years.

Please refer to [my personal web site][1] for more information about me.
