Docstyle
=========

(This document is incomplete.)

Docstyle is a very simple set of styles and scripts that can be included on
many websites. The styles are designed to be very readable for text-heavy
pages.

The scripts in this project depend on [the jQuery Library][jquery] for
JavaScript.

  [jquery]: http://jquery.com



Installation
-------------

Simply run `make` in this project's directory. This will create *script.js*
which is what you can actually include on your site's pages.  E.g.:

    <script type="text/javascript"
            src="http://example.org/script.js"></script>

Files
------

 +  *append.js* is appended to the end of *jquery.js* to create *script.js*.
    *append.js* tells the browser to load *main.js*.

 +  *main.js* adds 'showhide' functionality.

 +  *jquery.js* is the [jQuery][jquery] code downloaded from the Google Code
    site for jQuery.

 +  *script.js* is generated by the Makefile (cf. *Installation*) from
    *jquery.js* and *append.js*.

 +  *basic.css* is a basic stylesheet that can be include on a page, e.g.:

        <style type="text/css">/*<![CDATA[*/
            @import "http://example.org/basic.css";
        /*]]*/</style>
