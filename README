ParsedOut Readme
================

ParsedOut uses the [Docstyle][] project by Ryan Timmons to provide
baseline CSS and JavaScript support. It uses Jekyll to generate a
static site based on these files.

To get this site up and going:

1.  Make sure `blahtex` is on your PATH.

2.  Install MacTeX (the big package)

3.  Run `make` to get the Docstyle dependency

    a.  Run `make` inside the `_vendor/docstyle` directory to make
        Docstyle. (TODO: this should be automated by the main Makefile.)

4.  Run `jekyll` which will generate the `_site` directory.
