ParsedOut Readme
=====================

ParsedOut uses the [Docstyle][] project by Ryan Timmons to provide baseline
CSS and JavaScript support. It uses [rjekyll][] (a slight fork of Jekyll) to
generate a static site based on these files.

To get this site up and going:

 1. Make sure `blahtex` is on your PATH.

 2. Run `make` to get the Docstyle dependency

     a. Run `make` inside the `_vendor/docstyle` directory
        to make Docstyle.  (TODO: this should be automated
        by the main Makefile.)

 3. Run `rjekyll` which will generate the `_site` directory.
