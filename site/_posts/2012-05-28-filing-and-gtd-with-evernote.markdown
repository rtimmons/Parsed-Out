I use Evernote since it's so easy to get things into it.  The problem is, tho, that Evernote is a bloated mess.  The desktop software needs to be completely re-imagined, but there are ways of ignoring the cruft and making a simple and consistent workflow.

Rationale:

-   It is hard to get information out of evernote: keep things simple and lightweight as much as possible.
-   Don't confuse things with extra notebooks or todo checkboxes or whatever since that's too much hierarchy, and you will resist filing things properly if you have to create a new notebook for each project or have to decide which notebook something belongs in.  With tags, notes can "belong to" many tags so there's less overhead.

Strategy for pruning Evernote in a "GTD" Way:

1.  Create a new notebook called "General Reference". This will eventually be a "catch-all" for all your notes. You will organize notes with tags and not notebooks.

2.  Create a new notebook called "Inbox" and set it as your default notebook for all new notes and clippings going forward. This becomes an inbox just like your physical and email inbox, and you should process it down to zero on a regular basis.

3.  Create a new notebook stack called "Old Reference"

4.  Drag all of your old/legacy notebooks onto the "Old Reference" notebook stack


Now you can "process" your notes.

**Goal**: Get down to 0 notes in your "Old Reference" notebook stack and delete it. I.e., move all notes in "Old Reference" to either Trash, or "General Reference".

When you are processing notes, you should use the GTD Workflow Process that I'll let you read about elsewhere. Suffice to say that you'll be generating lots of trashed notes and lots of someday/maybes and next action items. To avoid your "General Reference" notebook from becoming a black-hole, use tags like you would manilla file folders.

Suggestions:

-   If you're on a Mac, you can use the keyboard shortcut Apple-Shift-/ to bring up the help menu. Then search for "move general" and it will bring up the "Move to Notebook > General Reference" menu item. This makes moving notes to a different notebook very easy via the keyboard. (Note: You can re-assign this shortcut in System Preferences > Keyboard. I shorten it to Apple-/.)

-   I like to think literally "If I were to print this note out and file it in a manilla file folder in my paper reference system, what would the title of that folder be" and then tag the note with that title. You can have multiple tags, of course, and this is where tagging is useful.

-   Don't over-do it with tags. Just enough to keep things manageable.

-   Create a "Read/Review" tag for items that you want to read or review later. You can create an action item to read items with that tag on a later date. You can create a saved search to help with this.

-   If you're like me, you'll wind up with lots of "Read/Review" items. I like to also have tags to indicate how long the reading will take or how much mental involvement it will take to read the items. E.g. I have tags like
    -   "RR:10min" for things that will take 10 minutes to read & review
    -   "RR:BrainDead" for things that need little brain-power to read (e.g. fiction or news articles or product reviews)
    -   "RR:Intranet" for things that I need to review while on the company intranet.

-   Once you're done, glance through your list of tags to make sure things are clear and defined and that you don't have redundant tags.

-   I won't tell you to delete notes, but trust me when I say that it's liberating. Just delete it. Really. I deleted about 30% of my notes just because the content was out-dated or no longer relevant to me.

-   If you're the kind of person who uses Evernote to compose content (maybe you keep active project materials in EN), then I'd recommend having just one "Project Support" notebook.

-   Review your notes and tags as often as you need to in order to feel confident that you've captured any desired outcomes. I find that it's helpful to make a one-character edit in notes as I review them (just add a space at the end or something) so the note shows up as edited, so I can easily search for notes that I haven't touched in a while.
