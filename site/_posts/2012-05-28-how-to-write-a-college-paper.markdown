## An Introduction

Since high school I've been told by teachers that I'm a good writer and that I have a very distinct voice and line of thought. (I'm not bragging, but I am setting the stage.) What teachers (and later professors) confused for "voice" and "line of thought" were really **meta-arguments**. (That is, arguments about arguments.) One of my history professors called me out on it but still gave me the 4.0 on the paper because I had done it well. It takes practice.

I was a Math and Computer Science major in school, but of course the school made me take social "science" classes in an effort to give me a well-rounded education. I actually found some of the ideas new and interesting, so I would say it was overall a positive experience.

(I put the "science" in "quotes" in a lame attempt to be ironic and in an attempt to establish that I'm cooler than school. Even meta-writing has an accepted style. But I digress.)

One of the negatives, though, is that in order to demonstrate you understand *anything* in these disciplines, you have to write papers.

I'm not critiquing the practice of assigning papers. It's probably the only way of assessing this sort of understanding; I'm just saying it's not fun to write them.

But it can be fun. You just need to "hack" a little bit: turn the paper into something you actually care about. I'll show you how.

This guide will not teach you how to cheat: you're going to get a good grade, and you're going to earn it. What makes this guide interesting is that it will teach you to write better and more broadly. Your papers will be almost completely re-usable across subject matters.

I'm not going to teach you how to "bullshit" a paper. Anybody who's taken an honors English class in high school can do that well enough. The problem with bullshitting your paper is four-fold: (1) it takes almost as long as writing it in the first place, (2) you're not proud of it, (3) you're not likely to get a good grade (a "B" is not good), and (4) and you didn't really learn anything. You just waste everyone's time.

Don't waste anyone's time.

The approach I'm going to show you is not necessarily *easier* than answering the original prompt in most cases. But having a re-usable paper served me very well throughout college, and it was well worth the extra investment up front.

My goal is to teach you the 'essence' of higher-education writing. Read this essay because you want to write a good paper, not because you want to do less work.

You would do go to read Strunk and White's "Elements of Style" book.  It's short, succinct, and probably way better than this.  In fact, go read that instead of this.

## Essentially It's Just This

The key to all college papers is to question the premise of the argument.

Ask *why* the question is being asked. I don't mean that you should ask *yourself* this; I mean you should ask your *reader* this in the paper. If you work it correctly, you don't really need to answer the given prompt. If you extrapolate properly, you'll have a paper that you can use multiple times for multiple prompts with little change.

You don't have to be smart about Subject X to write a fantastic paper about Subject X. You do, however, have to be smart. You can't simply reply with "literature means nothing unless it's read." That is a *fantastic* premise that applies to almost every English essay, but the tricky part is making this statement meaningful. I'll show you how.

This approach will **only** work in social-science-style papers, though, and there is a fundamental reason why that is the case, and I will explain that as we progress. TODO

Let's dive right in.

## Divide and Conquer

There are two kinds of prompts in social sciences: questions and commands. Question-based prompts end in a question mark whereas command-based prompts do not. (*Insightful*.)

(Other kinds of prompts indicate that you're probably not writing in a social science. More about that later in the section *Caveat Emptor*.)

Here are some example question-based prompts:

- Is Hamlet's "to be or not to be" soliloquy intended to be heard?

- Which of Shakespeare's tragedies is most relevant to understanding Victorian-era politics?

- Why did we go to the moon instead of feeding the homeless?

- How does the language barrier amongst regions affect literature?

- How effective was Alexander Hamilton's funding plan at ending international trade disputes?

- Does it make political sense for the United States to invade Canada?

- Does Wikipedia inhibit or foster learning?

- Is racism more or less prevalent now than it was before Obama's inauguration?

- Is the death penalty meant primarily to punish or to scare?

- How does Greek Mythology marginalize the lower class?

- In this course's readings, what did you find most surprising? Why?

- When will Poland legalize gay marriage?

- Does Facebook increase or decrease social visibility?

And here are some example command-based prompts:

- Analyze Foucault's panopticon within the context of social normativity.

- Analyze the reasons for the popularity of the Progressive movement.

- Explain the philosophy behind the Articles of Confederation.

- Describe Marxism as it relates to the United States foreign policy in the middle east

These are hard prompts. It would be difficult for anyone to fully research and make a compelling argument in any one of these subjects, but it can be done. Later in this essay I will outline approaches for all of these topics and explain how you can answer all of these--and many more--with one central thesis.

If you're lucky enough to get a prompt that's already in the form of a question, then you can skip ahead a little bit. But if your professor just gave you a "command" prompt, then your life will be more difficult. The command prompt TODO

The first step is to actually *do* some research. If you do no research at all, then you are (almost by definition) bullshitting your paper. Don't waste your time. You might squeak by with a 2.5, but I want you to get a 4.0. Resist taking copious notes or printing off everything you can find online and highlighting and reading in-depth. That is too much useless detail at first. You need to understand the subject at a high level.

I will first give you an impression of (1) how to answer these critical questions and (2) why they are important. I will then answer these questions for some of the above example prompts; from this, you will see precisely how to distill the idea of a paper into a malleable argument to which you can apply any sufficiently-advanced idea.

### Questions, Questions, and Answers

Ask yourself these questions and in this order:

1.  *Why is this subject interesting?*

    You can make anything interesting if you ask the right questions. You need to get motivated to think about this. Don't fret because you don't know a damn thing about the subject. Just read enough to figure out why someone (i.e. your professor) thinks it's interesting. If your topic truly is the dullest thing imaginable (think Bart Simpson's essay on silt), then skip to question (2) and come back here.

2.  *Why is this subject complicated?*

    This is absolutely critical to how you're actually going to write the paper. If you understand why the subject is complicated, you can easily form those complications as other ideas and argue for those other ideas instead of TODO

3.  Finally, a series of related questions:

    a.  What are the obvious answers?
    b.  Why are they obvious to me?
    c.  Are they obvious to everyone?
    d.  Are these obvious answers right?

    These form the basis of your paper. I don't care which subject you're writing about. If you can answer these questions and answer them well--if you can make your point--then you will understand the "essence" of the paper, and you will easily be able to relate this idea to higher-level thinking. TODO(finish)

I find the best way to "answer" these questions is to list down even more questions. I will go through a bunch of my earlier prompts in a later section, but go ahead and [take a peek ahead](#invadecanada).

### Making it Interesting: Do Research

You can write a very good paper in the social sciences with minimal or no research. Even history papers. Look on Wikipedia and read the first few paragraphs. Look at the first two Google search results.

I would actually **encourage** you to look for the exact prompt in Google. This is **not** so you can cheat, but so you can form an overview understanding of the issue. I'll discuss using papers you found online in the section "Forming an Idea." TODO

Whatever you do, do not do *any* research until you ask yourself the questions above. You need to do focused research, and you can't do that unless you're trying to actually answer a narrow, specific question. So don't just search for "articles of confederation;" instead search for "alternatives to the articles of confederation."

### Complicating the Issue

### Forming an Idea

TODO

### Making This Idea Reusable

TODO

## It's My Horn

In this section, I want to show you how to apply this to some of my example prompts from earlier.

### Is Hamlet's 'to be or not to be' soliloquy intended to be heard?

1.  *Why is this subject interesting?*

    I can't even ask myself questions without knowing what a soliloquy is. So I looked it up. The intro of [the Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soliloquy) is sufficient:

    > A soliloquy is a device often used in drama whereby a character relates his or her thoughts and feelings to him/herself and to the audience without addressing any of the other characters.

    So according to Wikipedia (which cites Merriam-Webster), a soliloquy is only supposed to be heard by the audience. So bam. We're done! Since the prompt says Hamlet's "To be or not to be" speech is a soliloquy, and since soliloquies are for the audience, his speech isn't meant to be heard.

    This sort of logic will earn you an immediate 0 out of 4 on the paper. Don't outsmart the prompt. You can, however, *question* the prompt. Here are some questions I already have about the prompt:

    -   Who is calling it a soliloquy, and why are they doing that?

    - What would it mean if it were to the audience? That is, what if it *wasn't* meant to be heard?

    - What would tt mean if it were to the other characters? (What if it *is* meant to be heard?)


    TODO

2.  *Why is this subject complicated?*

    This should immediately follow from your research into why it's interesting. If you can succinctly state why something is complicated, you can generalize the argument.

3.  *The Answers*

    1.  What are the obvious answers?

        "Yes" and "No." :) TODO

    2.  Why are they obvious to me?

    3.  Are they obvious to everyone?

    4.  Are these obvious answers right?



### Does it make political sense for the United States to invade Canada?

The United States and Canada share a huge border, and that border is relatively wide-open. Why have the two countries never had a major conflict? (I'm not a history guy. Maybe there *has* been a conflict and nobody's told me.) What is it about other countries that makes them worth invading while we leave Canada alone? Is it something about Canada, something about other countries that makes them ultimately invade-able, or something about us that makes us unwilling to invade Canada?

Is this a political issue or a moral issue? What is the difference between the two? If it's primarily a political issue, we wouldn't invade Canada because they might retaliate or we might "give off the wrong impression." But why does that impression matter more than the possible resources that we could get from Canada? (Are there any desirable resources in Canada?) What would this mean to be a moral issue as opposed to a political one? Is there a relationship between politics and morals? What is the nature of politics with respect to morals and vice-versa?

### Why did we go to the moon instead of feeding the homeless?

First, why did we even go to the moon? Whose decision was it? Going to the moon was done "by the United States" and not just some guy in his garage, so going to the moon was a decision made primarily by politicians. Why did we do it when we did? What other options were there? What was the popular position on the issue and why? How much did it cost, and what was the payoff for these costs? Second, what were we doing for the homeless at this time, and what could we have done? What would the costs and payoffs have been if we had taken the moon money and bought soup instead?

Does "feeding the homeless" really mean handing out bread, or does it mean enacting larger societal reform around poverty? If feeding the homeless is about societal reform, then that has to be considered in the earlier discussion of costs and payoffs.

TODO

### How does the language barrier amongst regions affect literature?

TODO

### Does Wikipedia inhibit or foster learning?

TODO

### Is the death penalty meant primarily to punish or to scare?

TODO

### How does Greek Mythology marginalize the lower class?

TODO

### In this course's readings, what did you find most surprising? Why?

TODO

### When will Poland legalize gay marriage?

What is the nature of marriage in Poland? Is it the same as in the US? Why? What are the cultural and economic benefits of marriage in Poland: why would a same-sex couple even *want* to get married in Poland?

TODO

### Analyze Foucault's panopticon within the context of social normativity

(I was assigned this prompt in an English class. See below for a more in-depth discussion on this prompt.)

TODO

### Analyze the reasons for the popularity of the Progressive movement.

I was assigned this in a highschool AP History class, and I bombed it. The paper was horrible, and I got a horrible grade. Partly because I'm not a fan of History (US History in particular), but also because I took the whole wrong approach.

TODO

### Explain the philosophy behind the Articles of Confederation.

What a drab topic. TODO

## General Tips

A random list of tips that will help:

1. Write your paper in **plain-text**, not in Microsoft Word or some fancy word processor. Fire up Notepad if you're on a PC or TextEdit if you're on a Mac (go to Preferences and change the format to Plain text). This will make you *much* less likely to waste time worrying about the formatting. A page has about four paragraphs double-spaced, but *don't worry about it*! A professor will *not* grade you down for having a paper of improper length if it's good enough (within reason). You don't need formatting like underlining and bolding and whatever. If you think you do, you're not focusing on the right things.

    When you're done, just copy/paste the text into Word or whatever and then change the spacing to double-spaced and do whatever right-aligning or whatever you think you need to do.

    Here's an example of what your paper could look like if it were clean, simple plain-text:

                     Hamlets-Soliloquy-2010-09-02-17-59.txt
        
        Is Hamlet's Soliloquy Meant to be Heard?
        ----------------------------------------
        
        According to Wikipedia, a soliloquy is defined to be a device that
        "relates his or her thoughts and feelings to him/herself and to the
        audience without addressing any of the other characters" (Wiki 1). So
        the logical conclusion is that, no, Hamlet's soliloquy is in fact
        not meant to be heard.  Yet what if, in fact, casual literary critics
        are wrong? Wikipedia seems mistaken in its definition of a soliloquy.

2. **Edit ruthlessly**. Cut your paper down as often as possible. Whenever you're stuck, it's because you don't know what you want to say. You've got yourself down a "rat hole" and are probably trying to convince your reader of something you're not even sure about. Instead of making something up ("bullshitting"), get rid of your argument

3. Make **regular backups** of your paper. Put the date and time in the file name. E.g., "OedipusPaper-2009-12-13-09-30.txt". That's

        Paper-Year-Month-Day-Hour-Minute.txt

    This filename format will be sorted by your computer according to date and time if you have a bunch of versions. Make a folder for just this paper so you keep everything together and clean.

    This isn't because your computer might die (although it might), it's because you should look at old revisions every once and a while. If you don't do this, you might lose a good idea and you'll be afraid to edit ruthlessly for fear of losing something good.

    (Bonus points if you're using revision control on your papers. I love [mercurial](TODO). But don't learn revision control instead of writing your paper. The date-based format above will work just fine.)

4. If you're stuck on an idea, put the word "TODO" in your sentence and **come back to it later** by doing a search for all the "TODO"s. Chances are you'll have a better vision of what you're trying to say later.


# Case Study

I want you to see the result of this method and what I mean by a "reusable" paper. Below are four papers that I actually submitted in college classes.

## English Paper 1

This paper was for an English composition course my freshman year of college. It formed the basis for the rest of the papers.

TODO

> We often say that people are "nice," "friendly," "good," "bad," "honest", or any number of characteristics. We define these attributes based on others' actions and trust that these actions are in accordance to the performer's actual identity. We watch others closely in order to identify identity based on action. We live in a world of constant, passive surveillance. We watch, and we expect to be watched. Regardless of where we are, we are rarely outside the visibility of others. Our relationships with the others are defined by how they see us and what sorts of preconceptions we want them to have based on how we project ourselves. From this, trust emerges as a central aspect in these relationships. Trust, defined by the Oxford American Dictionary is the "firm belief in the reliability, truth, ability or strength of someone or something" and the "acceptance of truth of a statement without evidence or investigation." Since human interaction is based on action, an individual's overall identity is defined by his actions. We must base the "nature" of a person on his projected image of self.

TODO: annotate

> The problem, however, comes from the extension of these images and the respective trust granted of others into different situations. Oxford seems mistaken in allowing trust to exist without evidence. Intrapersonal trust must be redefined as a function of context. In order to illustrate that trust and identity are not universal constants, we will examine trust in two opposing social constructs using Michel Foucault's panopticism as an interface for their comparison. We will set two opposing social constructs onto Foucault's panoptic foundation and relate their utility of trust. This will give us a clear understanding of trust and will then allow us to redefine trust based on these utilities.

TODO: annotate

> Look around. Windows are prevalent; cameras are everywhere. We are constantly reminded that onlookers and possible government intervention ensure that our communications do not always remain solely our own. Buildings are designed to allow inhabitants to see each other. The watchful eye is inexorable, but for some reason it doesn't seem as such. The constant visibility is easily ignored. A similar system of surveillance is observed in Michel Foucault's Discipline and Punish, a work which defines "Panopticism" and examines its abilities to control society. Panopticism "reverses the principle of the dungeon" (Foucault 321). The traditional ruler versus person model of power is traded for a person versus person model of power. Because society is visible to society (defined as "visibility" or "being visible"), all members of the society who are afraid of possible discipline must act according to society's laws and expectations of conduct. Thus, modern society is panoptic: laws and customs are designed to operate in a panoptic manner. Visibility is a perpetual possibility, but it is always an uncertainty. Since anyone has the ability to report social offenses and since there is always the possibility of being watched, one is forced to assume that any offense could be immediately reported and thus acted upon. Visibility in our panoptic society, then, is our basis for trusting each other.

> Trust exists in the panoptic society as a factor of Panopticism's grounds for effectiveness. In building form, Panopticism becomes the Panopticon, a building conceived by Jeremy Bentham. In the Panopticon, individuals are isolated from one-another and are constantly reminded that any action could possibly be seen and disciplined, but can never be sure if they are being watched at any one time. Bentham originally applied the building to prison inmates and was "surprised that panoptic institutions could be so light: there were no more bars, no more chains, no more heavy locks," (Foucault). Individuals are kept in order by the trust that they will act in accordance to that which they are despite any outward appearance. Visibility forces individuals to act according to their identity, and members of the society put faith in the imminent discipline of those failing to do so. If panopticism is in working order, then any variants between projected self and actual self will be seen and disciplined. Visibility leads to possible discipline in Panopticism and forces true action based on identity. Trust is central to the relations in this society.

> What happens, however, when we remove constant social visibility in terms of personal accountability of identity? Can we trust that people are indeed who they say they are? Does identity truly matter if it can be completely fluid? Enter, MySpace.com, an online gathering-point for the Internet community across the globe and, more notably, an antithesis to modern society in terms of panopticism. On MySpace, individuals set up personal profiles listing their interests, their hobbies, their schools, their hometowns, personal online journals, and many other personal attributes. Members can then search for others sharing common interests and list them as "friends." MySpace.com Inc. (referred to as simply "MySpace") is, according to its terms of service, "a social networking service that allows members to create unique personal profiles online in order to find and communicate with old and new friends." MySpace acknowledges on the same page, however, that "information provided by other MySpace.com Members (for instance, in their Profile) may contain inaccurate ... material ... and MySpace.com assumes no responsibility or liability for this material" (MySpace). That is, profiles are intended to provide an accurate virtual counterpart to a real-world personal identity, yet MySpace takes no active role in policing its membership in this regard. MySpace are sure to alleviate liability in the case of a misinformation, but they will do nothing in order to prevent it. And certainly it is not the government's position to police MySpace's membership because any false assertions are actively covered under free-speech constitutional law (Riley). Knowledge gained about others within MySpace is in no way guaranteed to be an accurate representation of a real person. Trust, then, can only be assumed to a certain level. Without discipline, punishment, or true visibility, the only thing that gives a particular MySpace profile any credibility is the word of the profile's creator.

> This MySpace society is at complete odds with the normal society in which everybody is visible, in which everybody can report social misconduct, and in which there exists a real fear of potential discipline. MySpace provides its members with visibility, yet such visibility is defined in its tacit fallacy. Discipline only exists in the form of mistrust. The only repercussion one has against another on MySpace is to tell friends about the other or to report him or her to MySpace administration who will do nothing except remove the Profile. Profiles, however, are unlimited in nature. One may have as many Profiles as one wishes. Thus, without true identity-defined-by-visibility and without the threat of meaningful punishment, MySpace is antipanoptic and can be compared to its panoptic counterpart epitomized by modern society.

> And yet, trust plays a very important role on MySpace. Yamiko Nara and Tetsu Iseda, Japanese philosophical researchers, conducted survey-based studies in Japan and the United States asking participants to "compare their own online and offline ethics." The study surprisingly reported "relatively small differences" (Feenberg 5). Participants in the online community approach the community with the same ethics they have offline. The online community of MySpace is constantly reminded of the dangers of online communication, but the ignorance-is-bliss attitude remains unfortunately prevalent. This attitude leads to an extension of the trust given to societal individuals (peers in "real life") to Internet individuals (peers within the MySpace user-base). Users are quick to forget how fluid identities truly are in such an antipanoptic society as MySpace, and they are quick to assume that the MySpace Profile they see is an accurate representation of an actual person outside of the MySpace sphere. The study says that a trusting person offline is likely to be just as trusting online. This leads to a very serious problem when the trust in the antipanoptic society is strong enough to permit a meeting of the two individuals in the panoptic society.

> In our modern social construct, crime is not overwhelming in most people's lives, and we remain cognizant that most any action could be seen. Foucault's panopticism lends a decent contribution. Decent, however not perfect. Crime does exist and murderers still go unpunished. Michel Foucault's Panopticism remains a perfect ideal: it functions only to a certain extreme. The fear of being seen only exists where it is possible to be seen. The temporary anonymity found in not being seen, then, easily lends itself to the complete removal of personal agency. In order for panopticism to be perfect, there can be no way to hide. And since our world is full of hiding places, panopticism remains only a foundation for societal control. Our implementation of panopticism is effective but not perfect.

> What modern society is to panopticism is what the Internet is to anti-panopticism. As much as people are defined face-to-face, they remain anonymous online. There is about as much chance of being caught in being caught in a misdemeanor online as there is in not being caught in a misdemeanor online. The two oppose each other in terms individual identity and action-versus-consequence. In his essay on online communities, Andrew Feenberg notes that "universal connectedness and the stripping away of context blur human values and choices in a universal relativism. " He notes that all information is "equally valuable and every communication partner is equally present." He then discredits the agency of MySpace-like communities by saying that "the critics conclude that nothing is really valuable and no one is really present" (Feenberg 10). This says that users should place no import in whomever they meet online because "no one is really present." It is so easy to be dishonest on MySpace because of the narrowness of the communications channel. People, identities, and interactions are based on text and pictures that are to be taken at face value, when in fact both are easily falsified. Yet because "participants are often able to overcome the narrowness of the communications channel and find ways to create personal images of each other despite it," users tend to overlook the possibility of a false identity because they are trusting individuals and, again according to Yamiko Nara and Tetsu Iseda, one's ethics online parallel those offline (Feenberg 12).

> A forty-seven-year-old sex-offender may, for example, pose as a fourteen-year-old girl on MySpace and seek "friendship" with other fourteen-year-old girls. The fourteen-year-old girls are na"ive and are easily manipulated and are fast to give more information to this online "friend" who seems to have so much in common with her publicly-available list of interests. The sex-offender, having bait, now simply has to instigate a meeting between the two. I will leave the graphic details to the imagination of the reader, but the dangers are quite incontestable. More concretely, "in December [2005], a 27-year-old [Raymond, Oregon] man was convicted of sexual misconduct and other charges as a result of a relationship he had with a 14-year-old girl he met through her MySpace site," reports the Portland Herald.

> The happenings of this unfortunate girl are a hapless example of the overlapping of a panoptic society with an antipanoptic society. She lived in a society that was ruled by social visibility and identity by visibility. People tend to act similarly online and offline, and her naivety brought about inappropriate levels of trust in an individual whose online identity differed vastly from his real identity. Certainly there is no problem in misplaced trust provided nobody gets hurt in the end, but unfortunately this is not the case some amount of the time. The man's online identity was completely false but was not subject to any sort of scrutiny and was not met by any sort of discipline because discipline in the online, anitpanoptic society simply does not and cannot exist. Both this false identity and the true one are capable of co-existing--they simply represent virtual representations of possible real-world persons. It is only when the girl trusted that the virtual representation was accurate of the real-world person that the real-world person was able to manipulate the holes in the panoptic society (i.e. being able to hide) to deadly ends.

> We can now define "trust" as the ability to connect one's portrayed and visible actions to one's true identity within the trust's context. The difference, however, between online trust and offline trust is that of projection. Walking down the street, one is, in general, able to judge a certain degree of a person's identity based on his self-portrayal or actions. Online, however, projections of self are only to be trusted to the extent where their context runs thin. The online projection of self can only be trusted online. It is when the trust is falsely extended to the offline context that collisions between projection and truth occur, and in extreme cases, end in the worst way possible. Comparing opposing societies on the platform of Panopticism, we have redefined the basis for human interaction: trust. Trust can only be defined person-to-person, society-to-society, projection-to-projection. Social relations defined by trust with or without panopticism, then, are subject to much different gravity on any different contexts. This is perhaps why staunch political fans or avid proponents of certain authors are profoundly disappointed after having met them outside of their original context. The politician may be meek off the stage, and the author may be taciturn in personal exchanges. This essay cannot extent as far as to say that projected identities always differ or that they always change by context or even that they can never be trusted. It simply defines trust in terms of context. Since trust is a function of context, a changing context could mean a proportionately variable amount of warranted trust.

## English Paper 2

This paper was for a fairly intensive, senior-level English course
on sex, gender, and identity (which anyone will tell you is one of
the most complicated subjects there is, and I'm honestly not
kidding at all about that).

> Foucault addresses the issue of sexuality as a function of society. Moreover, he notes that defining and observing "sexuality" before modern (i.e. post-Victorian) times is impossible; that the concept simply did not exist as we might define it today. The modern western society allows an individual to define him- or herself as a homosexual. The definite article, 'a', describes the notion of sexuality as a discrete identifier used as a social construct rather than a set of actions performed by a member of the society with continuous (read: non-discrete) desires. In so many words, Foucault describes the social metamorphosis of 'sexuality' as an act in the pre-Victorian era and now as an identity in modern contexts that value action over personal regard. Under close examination here is the "repressive hypothesis" -- the very widespread belief that modern society "represses" our natural sexual desires and (more importantly) its discourse on them.

> "Sexual repression," defined in this way, is a sort of paradox according to Foucault. A state of sexual repression is, quite literally, a state in which notions of sexuality do not enter common thought or discourse. Repress, however, is a transitive verb and requires both a repressor and repress-ee (i.e. one being repressed). Note now that societal repression requires transitive actions (either implicit or explicit). In particular, in order to repress sexuality, it must be done so by direct action (including the implicit action in explicitly not doing something). This action, however, is precisely in opposition to sexual repression by its very definition. This mutual opposition is a study of a society which Foucault says has been "loudly castigating itself for its hypocrisy, ... speaks verbosely of its own silence, takes great pains to relate in detail the things it does not say, denounces the power it exercises, and promises to liberate itself from the very laws that have made it function."

> At hand, this is a relationship between a society and members within the society. The exaction of power within this society is one of purposeful discursion. By markedly not talking about sex and sexuality, the norm is enforced. Similarly, if an effort is made to talk about sex, the social stigmas are so large that the recourse includes the reaffirmation of the society's view. That is, because society so largely disapproves of sexual discourse, doing so flames so hot in the face of dogma that the society immediately shuns the behavior, associates the behavior with its proponent, and reminds itself that its discursion is for the better.

> In practical example, the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy of the Clinton administration contended to show an open attitude toward homosexuals in the armed forces. It stated that an individual's sexual identity was unimportant in the eyes of the government provided it was similarly unimportant in the eyes of the individual. This may seem to support the notion of increased social liberty, but Foucault would say exactly otherwise. Following Foucault, this is a fundamental example of those in power (i.e. the government; the democratic majority of the society) exacting their power to control the connotations of sexuality. The policy by its very name implies that there ought to be something wrong with "telling" but that that one must not -- "Don't Tell." Foucault would liken this again to the pastor/confessor dilemma. The people say that they will not judge ("[We] Don't Ask") but that indeed there is something to be judged ("Don't Tell [What You Have Done]"). This forces a discourse on discourse by the exacting power -- the people -- the society itself.

> Foucault defines the need to identify self and others as the mere implication that that there is indeed something to be identified. This notion is conceived in a past where a society did judge wonton pleasure as an insult to society. This is traced to an ironically self-destructive revolution that continues today.

## History Paper

The assignment here was to...TODO

> In his essays on the human propensity to explore and the various cultural implications and reasons for it in a variety of contexts, NASA chief historian Steven Dick speaks of the "great Ages of Exploration." These are, he says, the "Age of Discovery," the "Second Age," and in the "Third Age." The last age, he says, we are still experiencing with our exploration of space. Dick continues by indicating that each of these ages is "the product of specific decisions of certain cultures." He concludes his first of 28 essays with a quote by William Goetzmann, "exploration continually looks forward in the direction of the new" and notes, "the space exploration vision must be seen in that context."

> To Dick, there is a certain mutual recursion between a society's exploration and its culture: each is a function of the other. This speaks an interesting philosophy for a historian because it speaks against the notion that culture is a product of its past. It is a "modernist" view of history. For if a culture is defined by its views on exploration and if those views are "continually [looking] forward in the direction of the new," then any society can no longer be viewed as stationary in time. Rather, it must be viewed within the contexts of change: it essentially necessitates the second-order nature of reflection for historians. By this, I mean that Dick speaks against examining a culture based on its goals and ideals. He instead proposes that historians ought to examine a culture based on the expansion of those or how those goals change with respect to time and with respect to the compounded nature of such changes to date.

> Traditional historians examine a society's ideals-what the society thinks is important. The vehicles commonly used to examine these are economics, religion, and dealings with other societies. 'Ad nauseum,' would say Dick. Dick redefines the nature of these to be second order: he says that each of these is a function of the aforementioned 'true' measure of society. (To examine how each of these is made second order by Dick and what that abstraction implies would be incredibly interesting but is markedly beyond this paper's scope.) This seems as though it would be impossible for Dick, though, given his "ages" of exploration device. The division and study of the nature of exploration into discrete periods in time seems to imply that the three are mutually orthogonal. This implication misses the point, however, and again must be taken to second order if even Dick's first essay is to be taken with any credence. Dick does not examine society within the ages. This is precisely what distinguishes Dick's analysis from, for example, Burrows in his "This New Ocean," where one of the author's main points is that without the Cold War, the United States never would have made it into space. For Burrows, the narrative is the progression of an event and what leads events to other events, and this is typical of most historians (and the candor of their institution).

> The distinction between Burrows (and the traditional historical institution) and Dick's essays is that Dick's essays refer to his three "great Ages of Exploration," in context with each other. This is, as he elicits by example in his seventh essay, a "discussion of the Age of Discovery as an interpretive framework of the Age of Space." (The Age of Space being a representative element of the "Third Age.") "In the 15th century," he says, "exploring [nations'] motivations were twofold: economic gain through trading or land acquisition, and religious conversion." Compare this to the space age, where Dick points out that a presidential committee "identified four factors that gave importance, urgency and inevitability to entering space: exploration, national defense, prestige, and science. Among these, national prestige was paramount." Notice that Dick does not discuss the change of events during these ages but instead focuses on the change of events bringing about the change of events. Where Burrows would discuss all the implications of a society bent on prestige as in the space age, Dick instead focuses on the change from economics and land acquisition to prestige and what this change means.

> Dick thus asserts that a certain amount of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is apparent with any sociological construct: we cannot ever be certain of the nature of a society because the society is defined by its exploration, and the product of the exploration must necessarily change the society or the exploration is not truly valuable to the society. Dick uses this valuation of human nature-its exploratory nature-to explain worldview, politics, and even religion within any social construct or historical perspective.

> This valuation of history and culture is both interesting and surprising because it calls for an entirely different sort of rigor and perspective. It is, in a sense, a Meta study of history. It is a study that when applied as carefully as has Dick in his twenty-eight essays is self-applicable. It is then wise that Dick decides to castigate his own implications in his third essay in a section entitled "The Railroad and the Space Program" where he discusses other historians' study of the power of historical analogy. Here he says "although originally suspicious of parallels with the past, present and future, the authors in the end saw 'the possibility of moving up onto a level of abstraction where the terrain of the past is suggestive of the topography of the present and its future projection.' They cautioned that as much empirical detail should be used as possible, and that analogies drawn from vague generalities should be avoided." That is, he says that his observation of the change of events is not infinitely applicable: he warns that observing the change in the change in the change (...) of events warrants incredible use of empirical data. Empirical data at second order is already philosophy (as discussed), so Dick warns against further abstraction. Dick takes warning from his own studies and wisely points out the relevance within his own construct.

> It seems incredibly pertinent to point out the irony of studying the "History of the Space Age." The space age is, after all, still ongoing and the beginnings of it are at best still very recent. Certainly the history of the wars and political movements that brought about the space age is interesting, but then such a study should be "The Modern Construct of War" and would be more of a political science than an endeavor into history. No, since this is a study in History, it must be taken as Dick treats it: a study in how the progression of events changes. While this does immediately bring about singularities, as discussed by Dick, such an introduction of this field into the canon of History is both remarkably prudent and increasingly relevant.
