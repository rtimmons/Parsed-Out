All of the project's actual source code lives inside the project's *Code*
directory.

The example repository layout was designed for use with Perforce but can very
easily be modified to work with Subversion, Git, or whatever else. This
example repo was also designed to be used with Apache Maven, but the only part
that's apparent is inside the `Code` directory: everything else described here
works for any sort of project with any sort of build system (including `make`
or what-have-you).
