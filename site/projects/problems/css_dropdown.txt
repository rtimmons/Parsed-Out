Our goal in this writeup is to complete a simple horizontal pop-up
menu using only HTML and CSS. An example of one would be:

<div id="finished">
    <ul>
        <li><a href="home">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="about">About</a>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="mission">Mission</a></li>
                <li><a href="profile">Profile</a></li>
            </ul></li>
        <li><a href="about">Contact</a>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="phone">Phone</a></li>
                <li><a href="email">Email</a></li>
            </ul></li>
        <li><a href="legal">Legal</a></li>
    </ul>
</div>

Traditionally this was done via complicated JavaScript. Even using a
framework like [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), it's still not trivial to
accomplish this.

What is crucial to this example is to use the proper CSS selectors.
Crucial to using proper CSS selectors is making sure our HTML is up to
snuff. As such, we first focus on the HTML and then iteratively add
the necessary CSS.
