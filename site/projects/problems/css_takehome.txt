This assignment is designed to test your comprehension of the basic CSS
selectors we talked about in day one,

 *  Tag selectors, e.g.,
    
        h1 { ... }
    
 *  Class and ID selectors, e.g.,
    
        div#header { ... }
        p.warning  { ... }

    and
    
 *  Descendant selectors, e.g.,
    
        div#menu ul { ... }
    

as well as some of the basic properties and values. This will be done by
modifying the [CSS Zen Garden][zengarden]'s CSS code.

Note that this quiz is designed to be completed *in order*.

## Getting Started

Navigate to the [CSS Zen Garden][zengarden] and download the sample HTML file.
(Or you can download it by right-clicking [this link][sample].) Open the file
in a text editor (refer to [the uwwebpub programs page][programs] for
information on how to download Notepad++) and notice the following HTML:

{% highlight html %}
<style type="text/css" media="all">
    @import "sample.css";
</style>
{% endhighlight %}

(Note that in CSS day one we had something like

{% highlight html %}
<style type="text/css" media="all">
<!--
    @import "sample.css";
-->
</style>
{% endhighlight %}

which is "more proper" but is essentially the same.)

Thus, create a file called *sample.css* and save it in the same folder as the
HTML file.

## Part One:  The Body

Modify the properties of the body such that

 1. The main text color is `#2A2A2A`,
 2. The background color is `#EBE5DC`,
 3. The body's font is Helvetica (reverting to Times New Roman if
    Helvetica is not available and to a serif font if neither of those
    is available),
 4. *All* headers in the document have a background color of `#A79E8C`
    and a text color of `#8C0B0B` and are *centered*, and
 5. Links on the page have the color `#194E76`, are *not* underlined,
    and have a white background.

{hidden Part One Solution}

{% highlight css %}
body {
	color:              #2A2A2A;
	background-color:   #EBE5DC;
	font-family:        Helvetica, 
	                    "Times New Roman", 
	                    serif;
}
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
	color:              #8C0B0B;
	background-color:   #A79E8C;
	text-align:         center;
}
a {
	color:              #194E76;
	text-decoration:    none;
	background-color:   #FFFFFF;
}
{% endhighlight %}

{/hidden}

## Part Two:  The Intro

Important to this section is that you do not modify anything other
than what is specified. All of the below modifications are specified
to be made in the intro (`div#intro`) section of the document and
should not affect other elements on the page.

Modify the **intro section** (and only the intro section) such that

 1. All text is 150% its normal size,
 2. Paragraph text is exactly its normal size (this may require some
    simple algebra) and the first lines in paragraphs are **indented**
    by 2 ems (you may have to look up this property),
 3. The first paragraphs in the intro sections (these already have a
    class applied to them in the HTML that you can use) are **not**
    indented, and
 4. The paragraph with the text "Download the sample html file and css
    file" is centered (but no other paragraphs are).

(4) will require looking closely at the document tree to see how to
isolate only that particular paragraph and not any others.

{hidden Part Two Solution}

{% highlight css %}
div#intro {
    font-size:      1.5em;
    /* notice that this is applied to the  *
     * div as a whole which is essentially *
     * a direct-descendant of the body     */
}
div#intro p {
    font-size:      0.667em;
    text-indent:    2em;
    /* text-indent is our first instance   *
     * where an em means something         *
     * different than wat it does for      *
     * font-size. We'll talk about this in *
     * day two.                            */
}
div#intro p.p1 {
    text-indent:    0;
}
div#intro div#quickSummary p.p2 {
    text-align: center;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the final selector

{% highlight css %}
div#intro div#quickSummary p.p2
{% endhighlight %}

was perhaps superfluous because the additional information about the ancestor
of `div#quickSummary` is irrelevant: there can only be one of them on the
page, so why bother specifying that you only want to select the one that is a
descendant of `div#intro`? We might just as well have used

{% highlight css %}
div#quickSummary p.p2
{% endhighlight %}

as this last selector.

{/hidden}


## Part Three:  The Lists

This part of the exercise involves manipulating the three lists at the bottom
of the Zen Garden page. Again, the changes made in Part Three should not
affect any elements outside of the `div#linkList` section.

(Note that there is an additional, *wrapper* div surrounding these lists. In
particular, the structure is something like

{% highlight html %}
<div id="linkList">
    <div id="linkList2">
    ...
    </div>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

and there is nothing inside of `div#linkList2` that is not inside
`div#linkList`. This is done solely for placement and alignment purposes. That
is to say, your selectors can use *either* `div#linkList` or `div#linkList2`
without additional consequences. You could, of course, use both, in the manner
of

{% highlight css %}
div#linkList div#linkList2
{% endhighlight %}

but this would be superfluous for the same reason as the descendant selector
is unnecessary in the solution to Part Two.)

Your assignment is to

 1. Get rid of all bullets 
 2. Put the bullets back in in `div#lselect`


**Solution left as an exercise.**
