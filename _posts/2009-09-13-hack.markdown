Just a simple usage of command-line hacks that you couldn't easily do otherwise:

I use [pyTivoX][p] to get movies from my computer to my Tivo.  A rather weird thing that it does, though, is sort movies based on modification time rather than alphabetically.  I was unable to build pyTivoX myself after a bit of effort, so I gave up on modifying it to sort properly and instead came up with this (very simple) hack:

{% highlight bash %}
cd ~/Movies
ls | sort > ~/movies.txt
while read movie; do
    echo $movie
    touch "$movie"
    sleep 1
done < ~/movies.txt
rm movies.txt
{% endhighlight %}

`touch(1)`, of course, changes the last-modified field of a file without actually modifying file.  This simply runs `touch` on each file in *Movies* in sorted order and gives the desired result that pyTivoX displays the movies alphabetically.
