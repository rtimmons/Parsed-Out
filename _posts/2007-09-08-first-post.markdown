Welcome to my new blog. The name, `$ parsed | out.com`, is supposed to be a
bit of a pun and a bit of a (BaSH) code joke, &agrave; la

    $  parsed | out
    .com

I decided that it was better than "allparsedout.com" and
"implicitlydiffed.com", which I also registered. I've had this domain for a
while and have finally gotten around to setting up a blog on it. For now it's
running on Wordpress, which makes me a little nervous, but it's the best of
the free blog systems I looked at. And it's better than me spending six weeks
writing my own.

Hopefully I'll write in this more often than I do in my other blog-like
things...

More to come soon.
