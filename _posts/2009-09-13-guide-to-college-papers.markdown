Ryan's Guide to Writing a College Paper
========================================

I was a Math and Computer Science major in school, but of course the school made me take social "science" classes in an effort to give me a well-rounded education. I actually found some of the ideas new and interesting, so I would say it was overall a positive experience.

One of the negatives, though, is that in order to demonstrate you understand *anything* in these disciplines, you have to write papers. (I'm not critiquing the practice of assigning papers because it's probably the only way of assessing this sort of understanding, I'm just saying it's not fun to write them.)

Since high school I've been told by teachers that I'm a fantastic writer and that I have a very distinct line of thought and voice. I'm not bragging, but I am setting the stage. What teachers (and later professors) confused for "line of thought" and "voice" were really **meta-arguments**. (That is, arguments about arguments.) One of my history professors called me out on it but still gave me the 4.0 on the paper because I had done it well. It takes practice.

The key to all college papers is to question the premise of the argument: ask *why* the question is being asked. I don't mean that you should ask *yourself* this; I mean you should ask your *reader* this in the paper. If you work it correctly, you don't really need to answer the given prompt. If you extrapolate properly, you'll have yourself a paper that you can use multiple times for multiple prompts with little change.

(I would argue that this approach is not necessarily *easier* than answering the original prompt in most cases. But having a re-usable paper served me very well throughout college, and it was well worth the extra investment up front.)

You don't have to be smart about Subject X to write a fantastic paper about Subject X. You do, however, have to be smart. You can't simply reply with "literature means nothing unless it's read." That is a *fantastic* premise that applies to almost every English essay, but the tricky part is making this statement meaningful. I'll show you how.

There are two *and only two* kinds of prompts in the social sciences:

 1. "Analyze this idea", and
 2. "Compare these two ideas."

"But what about comparing all of Shakespeare's tragedies?!" I hear you asking. The case where you have to compare three, four, ... ideas reduces to (2) if you consider that you compare two ideas and form a single idea. Kitschy. This kind of argument, though, is exactly what you're looking for. Compare two of the plays, come up with an idea that that argument represents, and use it as a basis for the next play. Continue (ad nauseum) until Juliette's dead. By the time you're done, your paper will be so abstract it will apply not only to Shakespeare's tragedies but also to any sort of art prepared for an audience. This is exactly what will give you a 4.0.

Here's how to tackle these kinds of papers:


Analyze This
-------------------

These kinds of prompts are easy to contrive. Here's some off the top of my head:

 +  "Analyze Foucault's panopticon within the context of social normativity"
 +  "Is Hamlet's 'to be or not to be' soliloquy intended to be heard?"
 +  "Why did we go to the moon instead of feeding the homeless?"
 +  "How effective was Alexander Hamilton's funding plan at ending international trade disputes?"
